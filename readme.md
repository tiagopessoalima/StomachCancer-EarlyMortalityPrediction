# Predictive Factors for Early Mortality in Older Adults with Stomach Cancer

This repository contains the code and data for a **prospective study** focused on predicting early mortality in older adults with **stomach cancer**. By leveraging **baseline laboratory tests** and the **Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)**, this project aims to improve risk stratification and assist in clinical decision-making using **machine learning models**.

## üìù Project Overview

Older adults diagnosed with stomach cancer face unique challenges, including comorbidities and frailty, which can impact their treatment outcomes. This study explores the integration of **geriatric-specific assessments** with **laboratory biomarkers** to predict early mortality risk, helping oncologists provide personalized treatment plans.

### Key Objectives:
- Identify key **predictive factors** for early mortality in older adults with stomach cancer.
- Develop a **machine learning model** that combines clinical and geriatric data for enhanced risk stratification.
- Provide a tool to support **clinical decision-making** in oncology by incorporating these predictive factors.

## üöÄ Features

- **Data Collection**: Use of comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGA) and baseline laboratory tests.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning algorithms to identify high-risk patients.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using multiple metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.

## üî¨ Methodology

1. **Data Source**: This study includes a cohort of older adults diagnosed with stomach cancer. Data includes:
   - Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) measures.
   - Baseline laboratory results.
2. **Machine Learning**: 
   - Models used include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron,Gradient Boosting and Decision Tree
   - Feature importance analysis to identify the most significant predictors.
3. **Outcome**: Prediction of early mortality, defined as death within 6 months after diagnosis.
